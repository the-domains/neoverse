  “Are we slaves?” a daughter blurts to the dinner table. Her father, Dagny,
  looks to the faces of his sons with a bleak hope they will do something absurd
  to change the subject. He is met with an uncharacteristic silence. No dice.
  “eMir says that we are slaves for the robot men.”, the girl continues. “No
  Geneste, we are not their slaves and they are not men. They were once women
  and men who gave up their bodies to help everyone”, Dagny replies. Geneste
  continues, “Is mommy a robot person?”. The emptiness of the chair to Dagny’s
  left suddenly seared his heart. Children can be so cruel in their curiosity,
  he thinks. “Mommy is with the dreamers now. She will visit you when she is
  ready. She loves you very much”. After the last of the last of the noot had
  been slurped up and not a moment sooner, the father directs, “Zhan, please put
  your sister to bed, eMir and I will clean up and prepare next week’s meals.
  And talk.” eMir’s head sinks even lower as his older brother responds with a
  dutiful “yes sir.”, starkly contrasting his own transgression. A sad greenish
  grey light hums lazily to life as young Geneste skips and hops into the tube
  room, her big brother close behind. Zhan herds her toward her own sleeping
  tube laughing distractedly as she gleefully relays her day in school to him.
  The little girl’s tube is adorned with paintings of flowers she had seen at
  the botany lab. Similar works of hers could be found throughout the home - in
  the closets, on the ceiling, they even saturated every spot within a short
  arms reach of the toilet. The boys didn’t mind once their own coveralls had
  been deemed off limits, until that point work had been somewhat embarrassing.
  Geneste got a running start and spryly launched herself into the flowered
  sleeping tube audibly knocking her shin in the process. Zhan quickly reached
  out to console her, but was deterred by a question from the girl, “do the
  robot people hurt?”. Not fully understanding the question, Zhan asks her if
  she means to ask, “do they feel pain?”. To which Geneste just shrugged a quick
  little shrug. Zhan laughed and said “I don’t think they do, they’re almost all
  metal parts. But, I don’t know.” “Do their hearts hurt when their parents go
  to the dreamers? Do they have robot kids? I’ve never seen any robot kids I bet
  they’re mean like robot people.” Zhan is accustomed to Geneste’s barrage of
  questions and always tries to answer her the best that he can, but sometimes
  he can’t help but chuckle and get lost in the questions himself. The little
  girl sees her big brother staring off and feels pleased that she stumped him.
  With a little smile she pulls the tube closed and catches his eye when the
  abrupt whoosh of the tube’s pressurization replaces the image of his mother in
  his mind with his sister’s happy little face lying under the flowered
  plexiglass. From the hall, Zhan can hear his father attempting to find out
  where eMir has been going during the time he is logged into school and logged
  out of the house. Zhan knows he’s been going to the Heartstone which floats in
  the void at the center of Daedalus station. The mind of every citizen in
  Daedalus is linked to the Heartstone during gestation and some say you can
  hear the dreamers if you listen closely to it. “eMir just wants to hear her
  again” thinks Zhan as he walks down the hall to the deskroom, making no
  attempt to silence his steps. He wants to know why Geneste asked about
  slavery. Zhan lowers the seat in front of his vertically challenged brother’s
  desk and reads the various mortalcore band names crudely etched into its
  surface as the tortured device boots up. “Grand”, he mutters as he lifts
  eMir’s grimy Oculus unit by its broken strap. “Even your desktop is a mess!”
  Zhan barks as he holds the Oculus to his eyes with his right hand and with a
  graceful flourish of his left hand all of the desktop emblems stand at
  attention, organized around a “living” logo for Parabola, eMir’s latest
  favorite group of screaming spacerats. In the kitchen, eMir is half listening
  to his father lecturing and half imagining what he would do to Zhan for
  snooping if only he could compete with his more athletic brother. "I'll think
  of something", he conspires to himself. "Are you listening to me?", Dagny
  interrupts the thought while revealing frustration in his tone. eMir has had
  his response chosen since he imagined getting caught ditching school. "If it
  weren't for mom, you wouldn't have gotten a parenting license. You're much too
  sensitive," He stabs. "Dagny". He twists. Dagny would be flattered if he
  thought eMir was being sincere and not just manipulative. In truth, the single
  father was not sure he could feel anything at all since his wife had been
  lost. "Perhaps you're right, my son. I appreciate your brevity and will
  consider reealignment to the cause. Speaking of the cause, I've been thinking
  about your future," Dagny retorted seriously. "It has come to mind that you
  may be an excellent candidate for the psychonaught program." eMir's knees
  wobbled as his stomach did a barrel roll at the suggestion. It is rare when a
  parent is able to one up their child in such a pissing match. Dagny wasn't
  pissing though. He believed he had no heart to break if he knew his son would
  become a drugged out zombie, at least he'd know his son served a greater
  purpose than being a pubescent little twat. Before eMir could fully recall his
  half hatched plan to zone out of Daedalus his father leaned in to lock eyes
  and relay in a near whisper, "that's not going to happen". The boys heart
  began racing, fueled by old contempt as the father repeated the corporation's
  mantra, "In the Daedalus Complex, everyone has a place and everyone is
  needed." At school with Geneste: "In the Daedalus Complex, everyone has a
  place and everyone is needed", a disembodied voice blanketed the virtual
  classrom with a mechanical sentimentality. Ekster huddled over her desk
  defensively, waiting for class to begin and to end. Feeling an uninvited
  warmth in her chest she peered timidly through her shining black crop of hair
  and was met by the beaming smile of Geneste across the room, erect with
  excitement and wonder. "Freneza. Cray-see", thought Ekster, her newfound
  negativity stinging the heart. Eyes to desk. Compelled to peer again, Ekster
  fell out of her desk in a start upon seeing Geneste's excited rigidity now
  less than a meter from her own face. Geneste took the liberty of hacking the
  seating arrangement, engaging in what Ekster may have hitherto her very recent
  introduction to the technological society of Daedalus considered witchcraft.
  "TIO ESTAS FRENOZO", the startled little girl growled as she pulled herself
  back into her desk, a chorus of distant laughter emanated from her hologram as
  she rose. "What does that mean!?", Geneste gleefully interogated. "It means
  I'm trying to-", Ekster began before being cutoff by the mechanical voice
  being sucked out of the class and finding herself alone with Geneste. "What
  did you do?", Ekster asked with concern in her voice. Quite the first day of
  school. "I paused class! Are you from earth?" the barrage continued. "We're
  all from Earth, bot". Briefly hurt, "I'm not a bot! I'm not from Earth I was
  born here are you a dreamer?" Ekster glimmered the slightest glimmer, Geneste
  felt it and beamed in response. "Well, are you a dreamer? Do you know my mom?"
  The question about her mother inspired in Ekster a bit of unthought admiration
  for the impossibly bright Geneste. Her tone changing rather drastically to
  that of maybe, could be, perhaps one day, a friend. "I was taken before I
  could awaken into the dream.", Ekster responded woefully. "I don't think I
  know your mom, and I haven't met mine. But, I will find her, as sure as the
  seeker found--" Geneste found herself alone in her room. The transmission had
  ended, or been cut. She felt robbed and held her self tightly hoping she'd
  meet Ekster again.
