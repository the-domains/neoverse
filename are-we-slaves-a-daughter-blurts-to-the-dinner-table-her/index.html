Her father, Dagny, looks to the faces of his sons with a bleak hope they will do something absurd to change the subject. He is met with an uncharacteristic silence. No dice. “eMir says that we are slaves for the robot men.”, the girl continues. “No Geneste, we are not their slaves and they are not men. They were once women and men who gave up their bodies to help everyone”, Dagny replies. Geneste continues, “Is mommy a robot person?”. The emptiness of the chair to Dagny’s left suddenly seared his heart. Children can be so cruel in their curiosity, he thinks. “Mommy is with the dreamers now. She will visit you when she is ready. She loves you very much”. After the last of the last of the noot had been slurped up and not a moment sooner, the father directs, “Zhan, please put your sister to bed, eMir and I will clean up and prepare next week’s meals. And talk.” eMir’s head sinks even lower as his older brother responds with a dutiful “yes sir.”, starkly contrasting his own transgression. A sad greenish grey light hums lazily to life as young Geneste skips and hops into the tube room, her big brother close behind. Zhan herds her toward her own sleeping tube laughing distractedly as she gleefully relays her day in school to him. The little girl’s tube is adorned with paintings of flowers she had seen at the botany lab. Similar works of hers could be found throughout the home - in the closets, on the ceiling, they even saturated every spot within a short arms reach of the toilet. The boys didn’t mind once their own coveralls had been deemed off limits, until that point work had been somewhat embarrassing. Geneste got a running start and spryly launched herself into the flowered sleeping tube audibly knocking her shin in the process. Zhan quickly reached out to console her, but was deterred by a question from the girl, “do the robot people hurt?”. Not fully understanding the question, Zhan asks her if she means to ask, “do they feel pain?”. To which Geneste just shrugged a quick little shrug. Zhan laughed and said “I don’t think they do, they’re almost all metal parts. But, I don’t know.” “Do their hearts hurt when their parents go to the dreamers? Do they have robot kids? I’ve never seen any robot kids I bet they’re mean like robot people.” Zhan is accustomed to Geneste’s barrage of questions and always tries to answer her the best that he can, but sometimes he can’t help but chuckle and get lost in the questions himself. The little girl sees her big brother staring off and feels pleased that she stumped him. With a little smile she pulls the tube closed and catches his eye when the abrupt whoosh of the tube’s pressurization replaces the image of his mother in his mind with his sister’s happy little face lying under the flowered plexiglass. From the hall, Zhan can hear his father attempting to find out where eMir has been going during the time he is logged into school and logged out of the house. Zhan knows he’s been going to the Heartstone which floats in the void at the center of Daedalus station. The mind of every citizen in Daedalus is linked to the Heartstone during gestation and some say you can hear the dreamers if you listen closely to it. “eMir just wants to hear her again” thinks Zhan as he walks down the hall to the deskroom, making no attempt to silence his steps. He wants to know why Geneste asked about slavery. Zhan lowers the seat in front of his vertically challenged brother’s desk and reads the various mortalcore band names crudely etched into its surface as the tortured device boots up. “Grand”, he mutters as he lifts eMir’s grimy Oculus unit by its broken strap. “Even your desktop is a mess!” Zhan barks as he holds the Oculus to his eyes with his right hand and with a graceful flourish of his left hand all of the desktop emblems stand at attention, organized around a “living” logo for Parabola, eMir’s latest favorite group of screaming spacerats. In the kitchen, eMir is half listening to his father lecturing and half imagining what he would do to Zhan for snooping if only he could compete with his more athletic brother. "I'll think of something", he conspires to himself. "Are you listening to me?", Dagny interrupts the thought while revealing frustration in his tone. eMir has had his response chosen since he imagined getting caught ditching school. "If it weren't for mom, you wouldn't have gotten a parenting license. You're much too sensitive," He stabs. "Dagny". He twists. Dagny would be flattered if he thought eMir was being sincere and not just manipulative. In truth, the single father was not sure he could feel anything at all since his wife had been lost. "Perhaps you're right, my son. I appreciate your brevity and will consider reealignment to the cause. Speaking of the cause, I've been thinking about your future," Dagny retorted seriously. "It has come to mind that you may be an excellent candidate for the psychonaught program." eMir's knees wobbled as his stomach did a barrel roll at the suggestion. It is rare when a parent is able to one up their child in such a pissing match. Dagny wasn't pissing though. He believed he had no heart to break if he knew his son would become a drugged out zombie, at least he'd know his son served a greater purpose than being a pubescent little twat. Before eMir could fully recall his half hatched plan to zone out of Daedalus his father leaned in to lock eyes and relay in a near whisper, "that's not going to happen". The boys heart began racing, fueled by old contempt as the father repeated the corporation's mantra, "In the Daedalus Complex, everyone has a place and everyone is needed." At school with Geneste: "In the Daedalus Complex, everyone has a place and everyone is needed", a disembodied voice blanketed the virtual classrom with a mechanical sentimentality. Ekster huddled over her desk defensively, waiting for class to begin and to end. Feeling an uninvited warmth in her chest she peered timidly through her shining black crop of hair and was met by the beaming smile of Geneste across the room, erect with excitement and wonder. "Freneza. Cray-see", thought Ekster, her newfound negativity stinging the heart. Eyes to desk. Compelled to peer again, Ekster fell out of her desk in a start upon seeing Geneste's excited rigidity now less than a meter from her own face. Geneste took the liberty of hacking the seating arrangement, engaging in what Ekster may have hitherto her very recent introduction to the technological society of Daedalus considered witchcraft. "TIO ESTAS FRENOZO", the startled little girl growled as she pulled herself back into her desk, a chorus of distant laughter emanated from her hologram as she rose. "What does that mean!?", Geneste gleefully interogated. "It means I'm trying to-", Ekster began before being cutoff by the mechanical voice being sucked out of the class and finding herself alone with Geneste. "What did you do?", Ekster asked with concern in her voice. Quite the first day of school. "I paused class! Are you from earth?" the barrage continued. "We're all from Earth, bot". Briefly hurt, "I'm not a bot! I'm not from Earth I was born here are you a dreamer?" Ekster glimmered the slightest glimmer, Geneste felt it and beamed in response. "Well, are you a dreamer? Do you know my mom?" The question about her mother inspired in Ekster a bit of unthought admiration for the impossibly bright Geneste. Her tone changing rather drastically to that of maybe, could be, perhaps one day, a friend. "I was taken before I could awaken into the dream.", Ekster responded woefully. "I don't think I know your mom, and I haven't met mine. But, I will find her, as sure as the seeker found--" Geneste found herself alone in her room. The transmission had ended, or been cut. She felt robbed and held her self tightly hoping she'd meet Ekster again.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27">Matter of Time: Prologue </a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>

Her father, Dagny, looks to the faces of his sons with a bleak hope they will do something absurd to change the subject. He is met with an uncharacteristic silence. No dice. “eMir says that we are slaves for the robot men.”, the girl continues. “No Geneste, we are not their slaves and they are not men. They were once women and men who gave up their bodies to help everyone”, Dagny replies. Geneste continues, “Is mommy a robot person?”. The emptiness of the chair to Dagny’s left suddenly seared his heart. Children can be so cruel in their curiosity, he thinks. “Mommy is with the dreamers now. She will visit you when she is ready. She loves you very much”. After the last of the last of the noot had been slurped up and not a moment sooner, the father directs, “Zhan, please put your sister to bed, eMir and I will clean up and prepare next week’s meals. And talk.” eMir’s head sinks even lower as his older brother responds with a dutiful “yes sir.”, starkly contrasting his own transgression. A sad greenish grey light hums lazily to life as young Geneste skips and hops into the tube room, her big brother close behind. Zhan herds her toward her own sleeping tube laughing distractedly as she gleefully relays her day in school to him. The little girl’s tube is adorned with paintings of flowers she had seen at the botany lab. Similar works of hers could be found throughout the home - in the closets, on the ceiling, they even saturated every spot within a short arms reach of the toilet. The boys didn’t mind once their own coveralls had been deemed off limits, until that point work had been somewhat embarrassing. Geneste got a running start and spryly launched herself into the flowered sleeping tube audibly knocking her shin in the process. Zhan quickly reached out to console her, but was deterred by a question from the girl, “do the robot people hurt?”. Not fully understanding the question, Zhan asks her if she means to ask, “do they feel pain?”. To which Geneste just shrugged a quick little shrug. Zhan laughed and said “I don’t think they do, they’re almost all metal parts. But, I don’t know.” “Do their hearts hurt when their parents go to the dreamers? Do they have robot kids? I’ve never seen any robot kids I bet they’re mean like robot people.” Zhan is accustomed to Geneste’s barrage of questions and always tries to answer her the best that he can, but sometimes he can’t help but chuckle and get lost in the questions himself. The little girl sees her big brother staring off and feels pleased that she stumped him. With a little smile she pulls the tube closed and catches his eye when the abrupt whoosh of the tube’s pressurization replaces the image of his mother in his mind with his sister’s happy little face lying under the flowered plexiglass. From the hall, Zhan can hear his father attempting to find out where eMir has been going during the time he is logged into school and logged out of the house. Zhan knows he’s been going to the Heartstone which floats in the void at the center of Daedalus station. The mind of every citizen in Daedalus is linked to the Heartstone during gestation and some say you can hear the dreamers if you listen closely to it. “eMir just wants to hear her again” thinks Zhan as he walks down the hall to the deskroom, making no attempt to silence his steps. He wants to know why Geneste asked about slavery. Zhan lowers the seat in front of his vertically challenged brother’s desk and reads the various mortalcore band names crudely etched into its surface as the tortured device boots up. “Grand”, he mutters as he lifts eMir’s grimy Oculus unit by its broken strap. “Even your desktop is a mess!” Zhan barks as he holds the Oculus to his eyes with his right hand and with a graceful flourish of his left hand all of the desktop emblems stand at attention, organized around a “living” logo for Parabola, eMir’s latest favorite group of screaming spacerats. In the kitchen, eMir is half listening to his father lecturing and half imagining what he would do to Zhan for snooping if only he could compete with his more athletic brother. \"I'll think of something\", he conspires to himself. \"Are you listening to me?\", Dagny interrupts the thought while revealing frustration in his tone. eMir has had his response chosen since he imagined getting caught ditching school. \"If it weren't for mom, you wouldn't have gotten a parenting license. You're much too sensitive,\" He stabs. \"Dagny\". He twists. Dagny would be flattered if he thought eMir was being sincere and not just manipulative. In truth, the single father was not sure he could feel anything at all since his wife had been lost. \"Perhaps you're right, my son. I appreciate your brevity and will consider reealignment to the cause. Speaking of the cause, I've been thinking about your future,\" Dagny retorted seriously. \"It has come to mind that you may be an excellent candidate for the psychonaught program.\" eMir's knees wobbled as his stomach did a barrel roll at the suggestion. It is rare when a parent is able to one up their child in such a pissing match. Dagny wasn't pissing though. He believed he had no heart to break if he knew his son would become a drugged out zombie, at least he'd know his son served a greater purpose than being a pubescent little twat. Before eMir could fully recall his half hatched plan to zone out of Daedalus his father leaned in to lock eyes and relay in a near whisper, \"that's not going to happen\". The boys heart began racing, fueled by old contempt as the father repeated the corporation's mantra, \"In the Daedalus Complex, everyone has a place and everyone is needed.\" At school with Geneste: \"In the Daedalus Complex, everyone has a place and everyone is needed\", a disembodied voice blanketed the virtual classrom with a mechanical sentimentality. Ekster huddled over her desk defensively, waiting for class to begin and to end. Feeling an uninvited warmth in her chest she peered timidly through her shining black crop of hair and was met by the beaming smile of Geneste across the room, erect with excitement and wonder. \"Freneza. Cray-see\", thought Ekster, her newfound negativity stinging the heart. Eyes to desk. Compelled to peer again, Ekster fell out of her desk in a start upon seeing Geneste's excited rigidity now less than a meter from her own face.
